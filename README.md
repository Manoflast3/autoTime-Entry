# autoTime-Entry

Automatically enters time on nvidia.ultipro
Currently only works on 1920 x 1080 monitors on google Chrome. (I have issues entering ultipro on Firefox). 

TODO: 
can configure x/y positions of mouse clicks
can configure start and end times as arguments. 
prints out what it's doing as it executes. 

Do not share this code.
